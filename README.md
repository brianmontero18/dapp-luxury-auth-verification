# Luxury Item Authenticity DApp

## Description

This DApp enables the verification of luxury item authenticity (such as watches and jewelry) using a "digital passport" stored on the blockchain through a smart contract. The application is designed to prevent counterfeiting, allowing users to verify item authenticity and authorized users to register new items.

## Access the DApp

The DApp is deployed and available on Google Pages.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
